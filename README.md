#  Smart Object Recognition using HuskyLens

## 1.  Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of the **HuskyLens AI Vision Sensor** to recognize real-world objects using built-in machine learning capabilities.  
In this prototype, the HuskyLens was trained to detect a **water bottle**, and once trained, it is able to recognize the object automatically and independently ‚Äî without the need for a computer.

This project serves as a practical introduction to **Computer Vision** and **AI-based object detection**.

## 2.  What is HuskyLens?

**HuskyLens** is a smart AI camera developed by DFRobot. It supports multiple built-in recognition modes such as:

- Face Recognition  
- Object Recognition  
- Object Tracking  
- Color Detection  
- QR Code / AprilTag Reading  
- Line Tracking  

The device is beginner-friendly, programmable via its onboard buttons, and works in real time without requiring deep coding knowledge.

## 4.  How the Project Was Built :

1. **Powering the HuskyLens**
   - Connected to a power bank via USB Type-C.

2. **Entering Object Recognition Mode**
   - Selected "Object Recognition" from HuskyLens‚Äô menu.

3. **Training on the Target Object**
   - Pointed the camera at a **water bottle**.
   - Pressed the "Learning" (‚óâ) button to save the object as `ID-1`.

4. **Testing the System**
   - Once powered, the camera successfully recognized the water bottle and displayed the ID on its screen.

## 7.  Future Improvements :

-  Add a buzzer to alert when the object is detected.
-  Integrate with Arduino to control servos or electronic locks.
-  Connect with ESP32 to send alerts over Wi-Fi or log data.
-  Train HuskyLens on multiple objects for broader applications.
